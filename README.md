# AI_Based_Food_Recognition_and-Calorie_Prediction
This project focuses on recognizing food from images and predicting its calorie content using deep learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to classify food items, trained on a dataset like Food-101. Images are preprocessed by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting before feeding into the model. For calorie prediction, each food class is linked to an average calorie value per 100g. To estimate quantity, segmentation or object detection (e.g., YOLO, Mask R-CNN) helps measure the food area, which is converted into an estimated weight using pixel-to-gram mappings or regression. The final calorie estimate is computed using the formula: (weight in grams / 100) × calories per 100g. An alternative approach is direct calorie prediction by treating the task as a regression problem, where a CNN outputs a single calorie value per image. This can be enhanced using pre-trained models and loss functions like MSE or MAE. A multi-task model can also be used with one branch predicting the food class and another predicting the calorie value. Evaluation includes classification accuracy and regression metrics like MAE and R² score.
